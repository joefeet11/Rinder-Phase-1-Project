Rinder is a web application that allows users to find roommates. Users are able to upload their own profile and view the profiles of other users interested in finding roommates.
For the purposes of this web application, we created our own data. 

 As a user:

    1. I want to be able to add my own profile 
        The profile should include:
         My name
         Contact Info
         About Me
         Roommate Preferences 
         property preference: house/condo/apt
    2. I want to be able to view the profiles of other users 
    3. I want to be able to like other profiles 
        - If like button “clicked”, increment the displayed likes 
    4. I want to see the amount of likes for each profile
    5. when I hover over the like button, the button’s color should change


The link below includes our initial mock-up for the website

However, we have made changes to the initial plan such as removing the filter, and instead adding mouseover event over the like button.
