Rinder is a web application that allows users to find roommates. Users are able to upload their own  profile and view the profiles of other users interested in finding roommates.
For the purposes of this web application, we created our own data.
 
As a user:
 
   1. I want to be able to add my own profile
       The profile should include:
        My name
        Contact Info
        About Me
        Roommate Preferences
        property preference: house/condo/apt
   2. I want to be able to view the profiles of other users
   3. I want to be able to like other profiles
       - If like button “clicked”, increment the displayed likes
   4. I want to see the amount of likes for each profile
   5. when I hover over the like button, the button’s color should change
   6. STRETCH GOAL: As a user, I want to see one profile at a time, with a forward and backward button.
 
The link below includes out initial mock-up for the website

However, we have made changes to the initial plan such as removing the filter, and instead adding a mouseover event over the like button. Additionally, instead of displaying all cards at the same time, we added a forward and a backward button, so a user is able to move through the cards, one at a time.
